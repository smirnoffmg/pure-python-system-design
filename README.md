# 🐍 pure-python-system-design

System design solutions in pure Python — using `asyncio`, Python 3.12+, and just enough despair to keep things interesting.

No frameworks. No dependencies. Just coroutines, standard libs, and the irrational urge to build production-level systems with the tools you use to teach beginners.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.12 or newer
- Courage

## 🧠 Included Systems

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `url_shortener/` | Async, minimal, and absolutely unnecessary. |

More designs to come, if I don’t burn out first.
